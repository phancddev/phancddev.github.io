            <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Michelle and I believe anyone can learn to confidently make recipe worthy of celebration.</p>
            <p>"I made your pavlova recipe today and it was deliciouq! As usual, your recipe was easy to follow. There's four of us
                <br/>here and there's only one third left. It'll be gone soon. Thanks for another great recipe!"</p>
            <p>"We tried your weeken bolognese recipe yesterday. Ohmygosh , it was so good. My husband is still talking about it
                <br/>this morning."</p>
            <p>"Michelle, just wanted to tell you I made your beef stew recipe this weekend. Just incredible !! The oven method was
                <br/>perfect and truly brough out the flavors."</p>
            <p>"I just wanted to send you a quick email to tell you that I really love your recipes. I have always loved to cook, but I
                <br/>haven't much of a baker. I have been baking more and more and I find that your recipes are always the best."</p>
            <p>Imagine your friends and coworkers gobbling up those specials treats that you made up for them. Imagine that the dish
                <br/>you made for Thanksgiving or those cookies for Christmas are all that everyone is talking about and EVERYONE has
                <br/>ask you for the recipe..</p>
