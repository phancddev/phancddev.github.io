            <p>I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father’s Day, although I’m not
                <br>entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my dad once or twice
                <br>growing up (although never on Father’s Day, ironically) and the correlation must
                <br>have stuck somewhere along the way. Although I don’t have a distinct memory to
                <br>tie the two together, German Chocolate Cake just seems like a “man’s man” cake,
                <br>doesn’t it? So many chocolate layers with a sugary pecan-coconut filling in between
                <br>and then iced in more chocolate… it’s certainly not a cake for the faint of heart!
                <br>With Father’s Day coming up this Sunday, I’m sure this cake could make many men in
                <br>your life happy!</p>

            <p>Up until recently, I thought that this cake actually originated in Germany, hence the
                <br>name. Turns out, it’s as American as the Big Mac. Who knew?! Way back in 1852, Sam
                <br>German developed a brand of dark chocolate for Baker’s Chocolate Company and
                <br>the resulting product, Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate, was named in honor of
                <br>him. Then, in the late 1950’s, the original recipe for “German’s Chocolate Cake”, which
                <br>used the baking chocolate, was submitted by a homemaker to a local newspaper. It
                <br>became insanely popular, so much so, that the company that owned Baker’s
                <br>Chocolate noticed and distributed the recipe to other newspapers across the country.
                <br>Reportedly, sales of the chocolate increased 73% , and the cake became famous.
                <br>Here’s hoping that homemaker from Dallas who came up with the recipe got a little
                <br>piece of the action!</p>
