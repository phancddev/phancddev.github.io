            <h2>Coconut Bundt Cake with White Chocolate-Coconut Glaze</h2>
            <img src="images/images/coconut-bundt-cake.jpg" alt="Coconut Bundt Cake">
            <p>Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for
                <br/>Sunday dinner. Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new
                <br/>dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people, since we have help
                <br/>polishing it all off and don’t have it sitting around the house, tempting us for days.</p>

            <p>I love anything with coconut during the spring and summertime, and Bundt cakes are
                <br/>not only easy but they’re pretty and are perfect for serving a crowd. When I started
                <br/>flipping through a couple of my newer cookbooks and saw a recipe for a coconut
                <br/>Bundt cake, dessert was immediately decided.</p>
            <img src="images/page2/download(3).jpeg" alt="Coconut Bundt Cake" width="600">
            <p>This cake comes pretty darn close to a coconut pound cake, as there is quite a bit of
                <br/>butter, sugar and eggs that help to create a wonderfully rich and moist cake. The
                <br>coconut flavor is derived from a large amount of coconut milk in both the cake and
                <br>glaze, as well as a healthy dose of coconut extract. I also added toasted shredded
                <br>coconut on top of the glaze because, well, I feel like any type of coconut dessert
                <br>needs to be topped with toasted coconut.</p>

            <p>A couple of years ago, a coconut cake would have never ranked high on my list of
                <br>cake options, but between the coconut cupcakes I made last year and this cake, I am
                <br>a total coconut convert.</p>

            <p>Plus, after everyone went home yesterday, we were only left with two small pieces of
                <br>cake. Win-win!</p>
