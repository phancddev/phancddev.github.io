            <p>I consider a really good pound cake to be an essential for everyone’s recipe box or
                <br>binder; if flavored the right way, it can stand on its own, but can also be
                <br>dressed up with toppings or cut up to layer in a trifle. Whether you’re looking
                <br>for a weeknight dessert or something everyone will love for a holiday or birthday
                <br>party, this cream cheese pound cake will never let you down!</p>
            <p>It’s incredibly simple to make and while a standard pound cake does not contain cream
                <br>cheese, it really adds such a tremendous amount of moisture, tenderness, and flavor,
                <br>making it, in my opinion, the best ever. This is by far my absolute favorite pound cake
                <br>recipe!</p>
